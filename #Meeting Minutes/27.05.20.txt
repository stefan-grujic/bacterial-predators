Perform COG enrichment analysis on COGs with Worst_pairwaise_comp_p <= 0.05
	- Same methodology with bar plots as module 6.
	- Perform sensitivity analysis by subsampling from the dataset can comparing results to full set.
		- Can be randomlt sampled or proportionately.
	- Calculate Jaccard distance.
	- Use FigTree to visualise metadata.

SKLearn for Logistic Regression model.
	- Bayesian hyperparameter tuning using Skopt.
	- Use ROC to find best model.

XGboost to make boosted tree model.
	- Compare results with logistic regression model.

Repeat ML analysis using randomised data and compare results.

Identify the number of genes which arent associated with COG identifiers.

	- We will potentially predict these using Tax4Fun.

Save all figures in a powerpoint as I go along, we will discuss which we should use.

Write paper in following order:

	Results > Methods > Discussion > Introduction > Abstract

Next meeting 03/06/20 @ 11:00 unless I finish sooner.
