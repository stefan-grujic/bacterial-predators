Command line extraction possible, but will not save time in this situation.


Analysis 1:

	1. Create tree.
		- Newick format.
		- FastTree.

	2. Binarise Traits.
		- Onehotencoding.

	3. Create table compatible with Scoary.
		- Needs to emulate Roary output.

Analysis 2:

	1. Binary classification with Regularised Logistic Regression.
		- XGBoost.
	
	2. Run SHAP.
		- Importance Analysis at individual level.
		- Interpretable Machine Learning.


Compare results with a randomised table.

Ape or Phangorn can be used to trim trees.
