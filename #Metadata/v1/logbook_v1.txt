Logbook:

13/05/20 	- Noticed C. hutchinsonii may not be predatory.
		- Changed "Respiration" to "Oxygen Tolerance".
		- Changed "Predation" to "Predation Strategy".
		- Unsure if Lysobacter antibioticus is Aerobic or Facultative.

14/05/20 	- Noticed that Streptomyces avermilitis is a potential opportunistic predator.
		- SUGGESTION: Instead of "Wolf-Pack", perhaps "Opportunistic"?
		- If we need to expand wolfpack/opportunistic selection we may want to include more spp from:
			- Streptomyces
			- Lysobacter
			- Myxococcus
